<a href="https://github.com/vincentwilliam/WPFSerialComTool/blob/master/WPFSerialComTool/WPFSerialComTool/obj/Debug/WPFSerialComTool.exe?raw=true">WPFSerialComTool.exe </a>For Windows.

When use the PL2302 for UART debug, it well make your computer restart(by Windows vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 & 8.1, Windows 10).
It is because the voltage drift of this chip. And the driver for windows is not so good.

We would use the version 3.3.5.122(11/11/2009) of driver with Windows 8/8.1 and windows 10.

My comtool would not cause your computer restart. If  ComTool cann't show your data, please reconnect the chip.
